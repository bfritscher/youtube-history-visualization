	"description": "Matt Gaunt \n\nBuilding for today's mobile web, getting 60fps across all target devices, while still delivering a fantastic user experience is a huge challenge. We'll dive into all the tools for development, testing, and performance evaluation of mobile webapps. Understand how best to develop with immediate feedback from the mobile devices you're targetting, scale up complexity to avoid hard performance decisions later. We'll also review all the possibilities of device testing locally and in the cloud.\nIn this session we'll debut improved remote debugging with Chrome for Android and the Chrome DevTools. You can now do local tunneling for improved local development.\nYou'll walk away from the session with a solid overview of the landscape of mobile web tooling and feel confident returning to your projects.\n\n\nFor all I/O 2013 sessions, go to https://developers.google.com/live",
